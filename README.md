# My version of the mini-tasks

## front-end

(I used Vite instead of `create-react-app` because I was testing it out to use in the project, so some random files may be different)

This is by no means the best possible version of the task, just how I did it.

Folder structure (not necessarily the best for larger projects):

-   components (ui components)
-   data (functions that handle fetching data)
-   hooks (hooks that I used to handle the data fetching inside components)
