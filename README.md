# AU24 web team mini-tasks

These are mine (the project lead)'s version of both of the mini-tasks.

## front-end

(I used Vite instead of `create-react-app` because I was testing it out to use in the project, so some random files may be different)

This is by no means the best possible version of the task, just how I did it.

Folder structure (not necessarily the best for larger projects):

-   components (ui components)
-   data (functions that handle fetching data)
-   hooks (hooks that I used to handle the data fetching inside components)

## back-end

I'm not very experienced with SpringBoot, but I tried to follow the conventions that I found. But it works.

All the code that matters is in Book, BookService, BookController.
